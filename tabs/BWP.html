                            <h3>How to perform the push up</h3>
                        </div>
                        <div class="BWP-pushup-howto-text">
                            <p>Begin in the prone position, arms shoulder width apart, and feet together. Turn your hands out slightly and place them directly underneath your shoulders. Engage your core and squeeze your butt. Make sure that your hips aren't sinking, and that you're in a solid plank position.</p>
                            <p>Lower your chest to the ground by bending your elbows. Lower your body in a slow controlled movement, without sinking your hips. Your thighs and chest should touch the ground at roughly the same time (but everyone's bodies are a little different!).</p>
                            <p>When pushing up from the ground, drive your hands into the floor to bring your body back to starting position. This is the most challenging part of the exercise, so don't arch your back to help get up quicker (it's cheating!).</p>
                            <p>During the lowering phase of the Push Up, make sure your head is in a neutral position and isn't sinking down or looking up. Don't flare your elbows outward, as this can cause shoulder impingements, and reduces involvement of your chest.</p>
                            <p>For beginners, pushing up from the bottom position will likely be the most challenging part of the exercise. If this is the case, try one of the easier alternatives, like the Incline Push Up. You can also try performing the lowering part of the exercise slowly. Doing so will help you build strength in the most challenging parts of the exercise.</p>

                            <h3>Benefits</h3>
                            <p>You don't need equipment to perform the Push Up. Saying that, equipment can be used to make the exercise more comfortable. Parallettes or a Push Up bar can be used to reduce the strain on the wrist. You also can use gymanstic rings or weighted vests to increase the difficulty of the Push Up.</p>
                            <p>When performed correctly, the Push Up can help build strength and muscle. This is especially true if you find Push Ups to be challenging. Once comfortable with performing 10+ reps, you can make adjustments to make it the Push Up more challenging, like Diamond Push Up or Rings Push Up.</p>
                            <p>The Push Up is primarily a chest and triceps exercise. The stress placed on the muscles distributes differently depending on your Push Up variation. For instance, with hands placed close together in a diamond position, more stress is placed on the triceps. The forward-facing section of your shoulders (the anterior deltoids) are also worked during the Push Up.</p>

                        <div class="BWP-plank-howto-text">
                            <p>Begin the exercise lying down with facing toward the ground. Stretch out your legs behind you as far as possible and come on to your forearms. Ensure your hands are facing directly forward and that your shoulders are directly underneath your elbows.</p>
                            <p>Suck your belly in and engage your core. Don't let your hips sink to the floor. You can prevent your hips sinking by squeezing your legs together and by activating your glutes. It's important to make sure your body makes a perfect line, so don't lift or sink your hips. Keep head in a neutral position throughout.</p>
                            <p>Hold the plank position until your form starts to break. Aim for holding the position for 30-60 seconds.</p>

                            <h3>Benefits</h3>
                            <p>The Plank is a fundamental bodyweight exercise, and lays the foundation for more challenging core exercises. Beginners may benefit the most from performing the plank exercise with perfect form. This is because the plank primarily targets various core muscles, including the abs and the spinal erectors.</p>
                            <p>The Plank strengthens the muscles that help keep your spine neutral. Because of this, you can also expect to see improvements to your posture. Improvement to posture can also lead to improvements to your back health.</p>

                            <p>Begin the exercise by placing your hands on the floor (or on whichever equipment you choose to use), directly underneath your shoulders. Stretch your legs out straight in front of you.</p>
                            <p>Push down hard to engage your chest and triceps. Pull back your shoulders, so that you try to get your shoulder blades to touch. At this point, your butt should be off the ground.</p>
                            <p>To bring your legs up, engage your core by pulling in your navel. Pull your legs upward off the ground. Squeeze your thighs together throughout, and aim to maintain straight legs. Hold this position for as long as possible.</p>
                            <p>If this exercise is difficult to hold, then you can choose a regression and slowly build up to the full L-Sit. One alternative is to perform the L-Sit in a tucked position.</p>

                            <h3>Benefits</h3>
                            <p>The L-Sit is a both a vertical pushing movement and a vigorous core exercise. By working on your L-Sit, you'll be strengthening your core, hip flexors, and quads. In addition, you'll also work your chest and triceps. By improving your core and hip flexor strength, the L-Sit will help improve posture and make your body more resilient.</p>
                            <p>You won't need equipment to perform an L-Sit, but parallettes or yoga blocks will come in handy for those learning.</p>

                    </div>
                    <div class="BWP-hands-content">

                        </div>
                        <div class="BWP-hands-howto-text">
                            <p>Ensure you've warmed up your shoulders and wrists appropriately before performing the Handstand. Here's a great resource on warming up to practice Handstands.</p>
                            <p>To move into the handstand, begin in your kick up position. You should look like a runner waiting to start a 100m sprint, only with your hands placed shoulder-width apart. Kick up with your back leg while keeping your other leg tucked in close to your body.</p>
                            <p>If you've kicked too hard your legs will fall over your head, and you should dismount safely. If you've kicked up with too little force, you'll fall back to starting. If you've kicked up with enough force, bring your legs together and squeeze. Engage your core and go into your hollow body position. By moving into your hollow body position, your Handstand is more likely to be straight.</p>
                            <p>Once you're in the Handstand, and you've engaged your body, distributed your body weight evenly across your hands. Instead of carrying all the weight in your palms, let some of your weight carry over to your fingers as well. Doing so makes it easier to adjust your positioning. For example, if you feel that your legs are beginning to fall back over your head, then push down with your fingers. If you feel your legs are going to fall back to starting, then push down with your palms.</p>
                            <p>It's also important to push down so both arms are straight, as this prevents your elbows from bending.</p>
                            <p>The Handstand requires hours of practice to build the strength and muscle memory stay upright and aligned. This means regular practice is necessary. It's doubly important to record your progress at regular intervals to measure your alignment. It's difficult distinguishing how straight the Handstand is while you're performing it.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="BWP-hands-benefits">
                            <h3>Benefits</h3>
                            <p>A Handstand is not just a major milestone exercise in calisthenics, but in a variety of other disciplines, like yoga, gymnastics and breakdancing. Performing a perfect handstand requires a lot of practice, strength, and a strong awareness of one's body. As such, nailing the Handstand is both rewarding and exciting. It's also makes for an impressive party trick!</p>
                            <p>What makes a Handstand such an important exercise is how it demonstrates great core engagement, shoulder strength and shoulder mobility. These are all factors that can improve your calisthenics performance. These factors can have far reaching benefits, like improvements to your L-sit, Muscle Ups, and other exercises.</p>

                            <p>Stand with your arms shoulder-width apart and reach up to grab the overhead bar. Make sure to use an underhand grip</p>
                            <p>Brace your abdominal muscles to create tension throughout your body</p>
                            <p>Pull yourself up from your stationary position until your chin is above the bar. Your legs should remain as still as possible and your neck should be in a neutral position, with your head facing forward. </p>
                            <p>Pause for a moment at the top. </p>
                            <p>Then slowly lower yourself back down. Force yourself to move slowly during this portion to maximize your gains from this exercise. </p>
